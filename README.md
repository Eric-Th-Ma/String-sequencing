# String-sequencing
lcs and align are written to quantify the difference between two strings. lcs finds the largest common string using tabulation to find common which character "path" results in the most common characters it also returns the strings with just these characters to demonstrate the largest common string, and align uses a similar process of tabulation to find where deletions must have occured in order for these strings to be aligned. This code could have a few different uses, one that comes to mind is to align DNA sequences in order to see where and how various types of mutation occured in the genetic code.
